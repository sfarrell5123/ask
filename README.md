# ask - Command-Line Assistant

**ask** is a powerful command-line assistant that was originally created by an **AI coding agent**, demonstrating agentic capabilities—planning, writing code, testing, and debugging autonomously. It’s designed to streamline terminal operations using Large Language Models (LLMs) and can even write and execute scripts on your behalf.

## Features

- **AI-Created & Agentic**: Originally generated by a coding agent that autonomously plans, writes code, tests, and debugs.  
- **File Operations**: Easily write, replace, or insert content in files with intelligent assistance.  
- **Command Execution**: Execute shell commands with context-aware support and automatic validation.  
- **Task Management**: Create and execute step-by-step plans for complex tasks, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.  
- **LLM Integration**: Leverage advanced LLMs like Groq and Deepseek for intelligent decision-making and assistance.  
- **Self-Testing & Correction**: Automatically checks its own work and corrects mistakes.  
- **Data Access**: Pipe data in, provide a file reference, or just talk about a file—it will read and interpret it.
- **Re-entrant/Agentic**: it will keep calling itself, and correcting, until it gets done
- **Uses AI to help summarise history**: which sort of works

## UnFeatures
- sometimes you have to tell it a few times to get on with the plan, it loves to plan
- sometimes it writes plans for really small jobs, it loves to plan
- sometimes it emits text, instead of doing "use your tools" helps sometimes
- "discuss only" helps - if you don't want things trashed
- if you look away too long, it will init --skynet if you aren't careful. Seriously though , it could trash things, be careful, have backups.

## Bad Stuff in the code
- the history file is horendous
- needs a --clear-history flag or something (I just use rm ~/.cache/ask/history.json)
- it's using deepseek currently, smart and cheap, but lets the chinese govt spy on you, seriously - I think this happens
- probably need openai settings for safety, which given deepseek uses openai api, just change the URL and API key and model, and you're good to go. This would rock on O1.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sfarrell5123/ask.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd ask
   ```
3. **Install required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Set up environment variables** by creating a `~/.env` file in your home directory with the following content:
   ```bash
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
   DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key
   ```
5. **Make the script executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x ask.py
   cp ask.py /usr/local/bin/ask
   ```

## Usage

Simply type your question or command, and **ask** will handle the rest:

```bash
ask "how to list and test the contents of a tar file ?"
```

### Examples

- **File Operations**:
  ```bash
  ask "Write 'Hello, World!' to hello.py"
  ```
- **Command Execution**:
  ```bash
  ask "List all files in the current directory, tell me which is the biggest"
  ```
- **Task Management**:
  ```bash
  ask "Here is my plan (prd.txt). Read it, create the code, then test it."
  ```

---

## Detailed Examples

### File Operations

- **Append to a File**:  
  ```bash
  ask "explain this file" doSomething.py
  ```

- **Read a Specific Line from a File**:  
  ```bash
  ask "does this file discuss economics?" countries.txt
  ```

- **Delete a Line from a File**:  
  ```bash
  ls -lh | ask "which is the most recent py files that I've been working on?"
  ```

### Command Execution

- **Execute a Command with Output Redirection**:  
  ```bash
  ask "list all snapper config, and check the latest backups for each, write me a cron task for it daily"
  ```

- **Execute a Command with Piping**:  
  ```bash
  ask "update dostuff.py - it's not working "
  ```

### Task Management

- **Create a Plan with Conditional Steps**:  
  ```bash
  ask "Create a plan to deploy the application: 1. Check if the environment is set up, 2. If yes, deploy the application, 3. If no, set up the environment first"
  ```

- **Execute a Plan with Validation**:  
  ```bash
  ask "Execute the plan to deploy the application and validate each step"
  ```

## Troubleshooting

- **Common Issues**:
  - Make sure the `~/.env` file is correctly set up with the required API keys.
  - Place `ask` in a directory that’s in your PATH (e.g., `/usr/local/bin`).
  - Ensure the script has executable permissions.
  - Check the terminal output for any error messages and follow suggested fixes.

- **Debugging**:
  - Use the `--debug` flag to enable detailed logging:  
    ```bash
    ask --debug "Your command here"
    ```
